## Check your Pocketwatch
```
/e checks a small silver pocket watch.
/run SendChatMessage("notes the time, "..(date("%H:%M.")),"emote")
/nod
```

This macro will present the current server time as an emote. 
It is useful if you want to play with the map clock disabled. 
As with the others, feel free to edit the first line to describe your pocket watch however you want!
